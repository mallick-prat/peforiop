Our current healthcare system leaves millions uninsured or burdened by sky-high medical costs. One-third of all money raised on GoFundMe is for medical bills! That\u2019s got to change \u2013 because no one should go bankrupt for the crime of seeking care.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Coverage for All<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Every Michigander deserves access to affordable and comprehensive healthcare. That\u2019s why Hill is fighting for a single-payer system that provides universal coverage to all residents, regardless of income, employment status, or pre-existing conditions. Because in the wealthiest country in the history of the world, healthcare should be a right, not a privilege.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Comprehensive Benefits<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Hill knows that dignified care can be the difference between life and death. A universal healthcare plan will cover a comprehensive range of medical services, including preventive care, mental health services, dental and vision care, prescription drugs, and reproductive health services \u2013 because Michiganders and all Americans deserve holistic, all-encompassing care.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Protecting Women&#8217;s Reproductive Rights<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Hill has always fought for a woman\u2019s right to choose \u2014 and he plans on taking that fight straight to Washington. Now more than ever, we must protect and expand women&#8217;s reproductive rights. A universal healthcare plan ensures access to comprehensive reproductive healthcare, including contraception, family planning services, and safe, legal, accessible abortion.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Lower Prescription Drug Costs<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Big Pharma greed is tearing Michigan families apart. In fact, we\u2019re paying 14 times as much as our neighbors to the north for a vial of insulin. That\u2019s why Hill will fight for serious prescription drug reform, including allowing the government to negotiate drug prices with pharmaceutical companies, promoting the use of generic medications, and cracking down on price-gouging practices.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"menu_order":0,"template":"","acf":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v21.4 - https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/seo\/ -->\n<title>Universal Healthcare | Hill Harper for Michigan<\/title>\n<meta name=\"robots\" content=\"index, follow, max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1\" \/>\n<link rel=\"canonical\" href=\"https:\/\/hillharper.com\/priority\/universal-healthcare\/\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:locale\" content=\"en_US\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:type\" content=\"article\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:title\" content=\"Universal Healthcare | Hill Harper for Michigan\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:description\" content=\"Raised by two doctors, Hill knows the importance of quality, accessible healthcare.

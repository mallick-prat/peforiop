It&#8217;s time that we protect, respect, and pay them what they&#8217;re owed to ensure that one job is enough.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Raise the Wage<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>$10.10 is a starvation wage. Too many hardworking Michiganders are forced to choose between food or rent. That\u2019s why Hill is taking the fight for wage justice straight to Washington, and will work towards increasing the federal minimum wage to $15 per hour.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Workers&#8217; Rights<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As a union member himself, Hill understands the value in organized labor. That\u2019s why he will fight to strengthen collective bargaining and support a worker\u2019s right to organize.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Supporting Small Business<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Small businesses employ 1.8 million people in Michigan, accounting for 49.2% of the state&#8217;s private-sector workforce. But more small businesses closed their doors for good in Michigan in the last three years than in any other state. As the proud owner of a coffee shop himself, Hill knows the challenges of opening up a business. That&#8217;s why he&#8217;ll fight for every Michigander to pursue their entrepreneurial dreams with the aid they need to reach their goals. That means working to provide access to low-interest loans, technical assistance, and training programs, while fighting to streamline the confusing, bureaucratic processes that keep so many budding entrepreneurs from pursuing their ventures.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"menu_order":0,"template":"","acf":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v21.4 - https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/seo\/ -->\n<title>Jobs and Economic Dignity | Hill Harper for Michigan<\/title>\n<meta name=\"robots\" content=\"index, follow, max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1\" \/>\n<link rel=\"canonical\" href=\"https:\/\/hillharper.com\/priority\/jobs-and-economic-dignity\/\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:locale\" content=\"en_US\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:type\" content=\"article\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:title\" content=\"Jobs and Economic Dignity | Hill Harper for Michigan\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:description\" content=\"Workers are the backbone of Michigan&#8217;s economy.

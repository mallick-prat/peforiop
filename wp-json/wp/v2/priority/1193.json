We already see the effects of the warming planet taking place in Michigan: heavy rainstorms are becoming more frequent, and ice cover on the Great Lakes is forming later or melting sooner. Summers are hotter and flooding is more frequent. It\u2019s time for Michigan to lead the way in tackling the climate crisis and build a brighter, sustainable future for the Great Lakes State and the planet.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Transition to Clean Energy<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Michigan has enormous potential for renewable energy. It\u2019s time to take advantage of this opportunity and break free of our dependence on fossil fuels. That means investing in solar and wind energy projects, and expanding energy efficiency programs that prioritize projects in low-income communities and communities of color. By transitioning to renewable energy, we can create thousands of good paying jobs while saving our planet and protecting frontline communities. Hill is committed to climate justice and won&#8217;t compromise his values \u2014 and he&#8217;s putting his money where his mouth is by refusing to accept one dime from Big Oil.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Sustainable Transportation<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Vehicles cause almost 75% of the carbon monoxide pollution in the U.S. It&#8217;s time for Michigan to lead the way in alternatives to gas-powered vehicles. That\u2019s why Hill will fight to expand public transportation infrastructure, while making it more accessible, affordable, and efficient throughout the state, and invest in electric vehicle (EV) charging stations to encourage EV adoption and reduce emissions from the transportation sector.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Water is Life<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>There\u2019s a reason they call us the Great Lakes State. Sadly, our abundant freshwater resources are under threat from pollution and climate change. That\u2019s why Hill will strengthen regulations to prevent and tackle contamination from harmful substances like PFAS, and invest in water infrastructure upgrades to ensure clean and safe drinking water for all communities \u2014 because no family should be without potable water.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"menu_order":0,"template":"","acf":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v21.4 - https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/seo\/ -->\n<title>Climate Justice | Hill Harper for Michigan<\/title>\n<meta name=\"robots\" content=\"index, follow, max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1\" \/>\n<link rel=\"canonical\" href=\"https:\/\/hillharper.com\/priority\/climate-justice\/\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:locale\" content=\"en_US\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:type\" content=\"article\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:title\" content=\"Climate Justice | Hill Harper for Michigan\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:description\" content=\"The science is clear: climate change is an existential threat to humanity.

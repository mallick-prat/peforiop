David Holmes, on Thursday announced its endorsement of Hill Harper for U.S. Senate. The endorsement, in the midst of a crowded field of candidates vying for the Democratic Party\u2019s nomination to represent Michigan in the U.S. Senate, provides a major boost to Harper\u2019s campaign. The Michigan Democratic Party Black Caucus, which provided early endorsements to the campaigns of President Joseph R. Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris, also launched a successful campaign to pass Proposal R in 2021, which created a task force to study and address the legacy of racism on Black Detroiters.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cEvery time an important election is won or progress is made in this country, Black voters are always the backbone of how it happened,\u201d said Hill Harper. \u201cI\u2019m running for the U.S. Senate to fix our broken health care system, take on the climate crisis, and restore everyone\u2019s voting rights. I\u2019m proud that vision is resonating all across Michigan, especially in Black communities, and I\u2019m proud to have the Black Caucus\u2019 endorsement in this campaign.\u201d&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Harper&#8217;s progressive campaign is built on the principles of social justice and economic dignity. His platform advocates for policies that support small businesses, protect and expand workers\u2019 rights, and ensure that quality healthcare is accessible and affordable for every resident of Michigan. Harper has pledged not to take a dime of corporate PAC money, instead relying on grassroots donations. If elected, Harper would be the only current union member in the U.S. Senate.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cThere are lots of candidates running for this seat, but only one with the right combination of experience, judgment, and wisdom to serve our state well, and that\u2019s Hill Harper,\u201d said Keith Williams, Chairman of the Michigan Democratic Party Black Caucus. \u201cWe know that when he gets to DC, he won\u2019t just fold to special interests or what lobbyists want him to do; he will fight for what\u2019s right, and make sure all of us are represented in Washington. That\u2019s why we\u2019re endorsing his campaign, and we will do everything we can in the coming days to make sure he wins.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Harper\u2019s passion for public service came early in life, raised in the Midwest by two doctors who taught Hill that his purpose was to make life better for everyone. That passion for service took him to the campus of Harvard Law School, to the campaign trail as a top surrogate for his classmate President Barack Obama, and to the White House where he sat on the President\u2019s Cancer Panel. Over the course of his career, Harper has also written several best-selling books aimed at empowering marginalized young people, and established a charitable foundation that helps young people achieve their dreams through scholarships, mentorships and grants.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For more information about Hill Harper&#8217;s campaign for the U.S. Senate, visit www.hillharper.com.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\">###<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>September 4, 2023Contact: press@hillharper.com MICHIGAN DEMOCRATIC BLACK CAUCUS ENDORSES HILL HARPER FOR U.S. SENATE DETROIT \u2013 The Michigan Democratic Party Black Caucus, founded by the late Sen.
